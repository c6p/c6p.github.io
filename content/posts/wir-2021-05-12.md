I'm differing with the author of first link, it is not that people do not read anymore, but the forms have changed into tweets, WhatsApp messages and blog posts. So what we read is more quickly forgotten. I am going to periodically document what I read and my short highlights. In another post we will be in search of better ways to capture information. 

While preparing this post, what I find most difficult is to choose highlights to summarize the essence of a text. Anyways, here is today's highlights.
<!--more-->
* [The one where writing books is not really a good idea](https://ellegriffin.substack.com/p/creator-economy-for-fiction-authors)
  > "*98* percent of the books that publishers released in 2020 sold fewer than *5,000* copies." — Only 11 books that sold more than *500,000* copies — 10 best-performing Netflix films saw more than *68 million* views. — just aren’t enough people willing to pay for fiction.
  >
  > "Publishers are always looking for people with really big platforms. If Kanye West is going to publish a book, he's got a big audience already — can become a bestselling book immediately."

  > **Which platform is best for fiction writers:** [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/) and [AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/) for reads over earnings — writer retains the rights to their work. With [Amazon Vella](https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/86072-amazon-debuts-self-published-kindle-vella-story-format-for-ios-devices.html) — it cannot be published anywhere else — Amazon is earning 50 percent of the earnings. [Substack](https://substack.com/) and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) have the edge when it comes to monetizing serial content — allow the author to maintain the rights to their work.

  > Why would a reader pay $5/month to read four chapters of a book each month when they could buy a whole book on Kindle for $1.99? - Readers to have the option to join an exclusive online community. — The creator economy might not work for fiction authors—nothing else really has since the invention of the television.

  In Turkey [Kitapyurdu Doğrudan Yayıncılık](https://kdy.kitapyurdu.com/) attempts something like Amazon Vela.

* [Are some personalities just better?](https://dynomight.net/better-personalities/)
  > Personality traits are around [40% genetic](https://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/Heritability-of-Personality-A-Meta-Analysis-of-Behavior-Genetic-Studies.pdf).  
  > **all-blues** more happy, successful, intelligent, creative, and popular — fewer addictions and less of every mental disorder. 
  > {{< figure src="attachments/wir-2021-05-12-1.png" link="https://dynomight.net/img/personalities/vals_nor.svg" class="right" >}}
  > {{< figure src="attachments/2021-05-12-09-56-55.png" link="https://dynomight.net/img/personalities/model1.svg" class="right" >}}
  > Evolution only wants you to pass on your genes. — Extroverted men having 0.8 more grandchildren than introverted. — we’re evolving in an all-blue direction.
  >
  > Do successful people still tend to be all-blue?  
  > Among [recent presidents, we see high *extraversion*, low *agreeableness*](https://dynomight.net/img/personalities/prez.svg), and no clear trend otherwise. — This isn’t to say that presidents are all [narcissists or psychopaths](https://dynomight.net/img/personalities/badvals.svg). — same equilibrium process. If there were no psychopaths, the first one to show up would probably manipulate everyone.

* [Crazy New Ideas](http://paulgraham.com/newideas.html)
  > ...both a domain expert and a reasonable person proposed an idea that sounded preposterous, I'd be very reluctant to say "That will never work." — that's how big things start. — wise response to such an idea is not to make statements, but to ask questions. — Are they mistaken, or are you? One of you has to be.
  >  
  > It's easy to launch a devastating attack on a new idea, and anyone who does will seem clever. — Popping out of the current paradigm is something only a few people can do. 
  > 
  > Few understand how feeble new ideas look when they first appear. — encourage them. Having new ideas is a lonely business.
