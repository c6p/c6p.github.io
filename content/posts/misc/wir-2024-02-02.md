* David Thompson shares [his favorite commit](https://dhwthompson.com/2019/my-favourite-git-commit) from his time on GOV.UK. The post has introduced me to the idea of [coding in the open](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2017/09/04/the-benefits-of-coding-in-the-open/). Here is why he likes it:
    > * explains the reason for the change
    > * searchable
    > * tells a story
    > * makes everyone a little smarter
    > * adds an extra bit of human context
* Joel Chippindale talks about [telling stories through your commits](https://blog.mocoso.co.uk/talks/2015/01/12/telling-stories-through-your-commits/). He tells that VCS is kept forever, always up to date and searchable.
    > `git log --grep='Commit contents'` search all the contents of all your commit messages
    > `git log -S 'Diff contents'` search all the contents of all the code changes
    > `git blame` where each line of code was last changed
    >
    > So, how do we make sure that this documentation **tells a useful story?**
    > 1. Make atomic commits
    >   minimum viable commit, avoid 'and' in commit messages
    > 2. Write good commit messages
    >   links to a place which explains more about the problem
    > 3. Revise your development history before sharing
    >   `git rebase --interactive`
